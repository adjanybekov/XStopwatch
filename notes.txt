Right now, if the app restarts and the saved state indicates that we have a running stopwatch and/or timer,
we will only restart the appropriate notification when the user launches the app in question first.
Meanwhile, the watchface might be indicating that a timer and/or stopwatch are running. The problem
is that we can't just start up a notification for an activity that hasn't actually begun yet.

Given that the notifications are really a bad UI kludge, especially when we have a timer and a stopwatch
both running at the same time, we're going to leave this alone for now.

TODO make XStopwatch and XTimer be "always on"
TODO See if the TimePicker actually works under Marshmallow
-- nope, still busted

TODO Long term: ponder merging XStopwatch into CalWatch, using interactive watchface stuff
TODO Dig into "okay google, set a 7 minute timer" -- why is it not consistently telling us what's going on?
